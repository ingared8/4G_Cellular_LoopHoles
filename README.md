# 4G Cellular LoopHoles

  This project was carried out to demonstrate some of the data charging problems in 4G Cellular networks. 
  A framework to explore more extended attacks have been built in this demo too. 
  
  Users would gain better and deeper understanding of cellular networks as they use this app anytime 
  anywhere to collect data and compare the data difference. While the researchers can easily extend 
  others attacks in our framework. This report analyzed root causes of three attacks namely, TTL attack, 
  Ping-Pong attack, and Back 3G attack, which are the most visual problems in this area. 

  The project explains the implementation and evaluated results of these attacks.
  More info can be found in the report titled "Security Loopholes in Wireless Networks.pdf".
